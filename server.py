from flask import Flask  # Import Flask to allow us to create our app
app = Flask(__name__)    # Create a new instance of the Flask class called "app"


# 1. localhost:5000/ - have it say "Hello World!"
@app.route('/')          # The "@" decorator associates this route with the function immediately following
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'  # Return the string 'Hello World!' as a response


# 2. localhost:5000/dojo - have it say "Dojo!"
@app.route('/dojo')          
def dojo():
    return 'Dojo!' 

# 3. Create one url pattern and function that can handle the following examples:
    #localhost:5000/say/flask - have it say "Hi Flask!"
    #localhost:5000/say/michael - have it say "Hi Michael!"
    #localhost:5000/say/john - have it say "Hi John!"
# Opci√≥n 1
@app.route('/say/<name>') # for a route '/hello/____' anything after '/hello/' gets passed as a variable 'name'
def say(name):
    print(say )
    return "Hi "  + name.capitalize() + "!"


# 4. Create one url pattern and function that can handle the following examples (HINT: int() will come in handy! For example int("35") returns 35):
    #localhost:5000/repeat/35/hello - have it say "hello" 35 times
    #localhost:5000/repeat/80/bye - have it say "bye" 80 times
    #localhost:5000/repeat/99/dogs - have it say "dogs" 99 times

@app.route('/repeat/<num>/<text>')
def repeater(num, text):
    return f"{text}<br>" * int(num)
